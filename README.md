# dj_docker_celery
Dockerizing a django project and including celery package

Dockerizing a Django App allows us to create an container that allows oup app to run seamlessly in any environment.
Celery allows us to run tasks synchronously (i.e one after the other in a block manner) and asynchronously(i.e parallel processing meaning all tasks are being evaluated or executed at the same time) within our Django app.
